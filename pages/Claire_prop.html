<header>How might we establish better recycling habits at home?</header>

<br>

<span>The best way of recycling is to re-use. In this processing, there is nearly no waste. For example, old magazines can be used as wrappers, a wool coat can be made a few wool hats and waste water can be used to flush the toilet. Re-use depends a lot on a person's creativity.

In addition, there must be a perfect recycling system. People can send their household waste, and these things would be collected and made into other products. In this system, a family would act as the provider of the waste, there must be collectors to collect the waste, transporters to transport the waste, factories to process the waste into new products and stores to sale them. During this processing, some waste might be collected to used in other ways, for example: some waste can be burned to generate power.

In summary, the aim of recycling is to reduce waste and make full use of resources.
