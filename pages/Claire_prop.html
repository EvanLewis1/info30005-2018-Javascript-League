<header>How might we establish better recycling habits at home?</header>

<br>

<span>he best way of recycling is to re-use. In this processing, there is nearly no waste. For example, old magazines can be used as wrappers, a wool coat can be made a few wool hats and waste water can be used to flush the toilet. Re-use depends a lot on a person's creativity.

In addition, there must be a perfect recycling system on the Internet which could connect each family to collectors, transporters, factories and stores. Moreover, in this system, each family could send the data about what kinds of waste they have, the amount of the waste to collectors and when the waste could be collected. Collectors could arrange the proper time to collect and classify the waste of each family according to the material, and inform transporters to transport the waste to different factories according to the waste varieties. Factories could process various products, and submit the information of products to the system in order that stores could purchase these products and sell. Also, locations of the stores, the information of these products including price, material, size and color could be found in this system. Each family could use the system to buy new things.

In some cases, the waste which could not be used to produce new products might be collected and transported to specific factories to use in other ways, for example: some waste can be burned to generate power.

Besides, there could be a webpage in the recycling system which families can post their questions or advices about re-use, and could get the better way of recycling.
