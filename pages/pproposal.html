<header> How might we use the power of communities to financially empower those who need it most?</header>

<br>

<span>Community collectives can be set up to link people together and open up opportunities for mutual support. These collectives can be set up in community centres, or in the absence of public infrastructure can instead run in the homes of its members.
Community collectives can run monthly “raffles” where each member gives a small amount of money to the group to be given at the end of the month to a member who has suffered an economical setback, e.g. a fire, a robbery or injury that keeps a relative from working. This system can strengthen communities’ resistance to disaster when insurance is not available or affordable.
A strong communal interconnectedness also helps in connecting abled workers with employers, lowering unemployment and poverty as well as raising the labour power of the community as a whole .
